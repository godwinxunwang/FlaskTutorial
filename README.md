# Flask Setup Practice

`
You want to develop an application with Python and Flask?
Here you have the chance to learn by example. In this tutorial, we will create a simple microblogging application.
It only supports one user that can create text-only entries and there are no feeds or comments, but it still features everything you need to get started. We will use Flask and SQLite as a database (which comes out of the box with Python) so there is nothing else you need.
